    about: 
    - 🌊 My name is Max, and I'm a Software Engineer, writer, builder, and weight-lifter.  
    - I've been happily working in software engineering full-time ever since graduating with 
    - a degree in Mathematics from SUNY Geneseo in 2017.

    tech:
    - 💻 At my 9-5 I'm currently working a lot with Terraform and Kubernetes
    - to build out automated, declarative, highly available distributed systems.
    - In my personal ventures I am building MaxFindsCars.com, and having a ton of fun doing it!

    leisure:
    - 🏎️ When I am not hacking away at work and/or on GitHub, I spend my time wrenching on
    - my project car (now a 1982 Porsche 911SC, previously a BMW E39 M5!), reading business or sci-fi books, playing games, exercising, or in the sauna.
