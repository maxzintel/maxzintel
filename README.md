    - 🌊 My name is Max, and I'm a Software Leader, writer, builder, and weight-lifter.

    - a degree in Mathematics from SUNY Geneseo in 2017.

    tech:

    - DevOps, AWS, Security, and projects to develop automated, declarative, & highly available distributed systems.
    - Recently, my primary goal at Funnel has been tearing down needless boundaries to facilitate developer velocity to its maximum extent.

    leisure:
    - 🏎️ When I am not hacking away at work and/or on MaxFindsCars, I spend my time wrenching on
    - my project car (now a 1982 Porsche 911SC, previously a BMW E39 M5!), reading business or sci-fi books, lifting weights, playing sports, or am in the sauna.
