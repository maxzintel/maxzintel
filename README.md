```
🌊 My name is Max, and I'm a DevOps Engineer currently working at BMW in South Carolina.  
I've been working in software engineering for about 4 years since graduating with 
a degree in Mathematics from SUNY Geneseo.
   
💻 I'm currently working a lot with Terraform and Kubernetes (checkout my repo s1dequest/turbo!) 
to build out automated, declarative, highly available distributed systems.
  
🏎️ When I am not hacking away at work and/or on GitHub, I generally spend my time 
drooling over cars, playing games, exercising, or learning the banjo.
  
📮 Contact me via email (maxz@hey.com) or LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/max-zintel).
